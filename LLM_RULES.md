1. Start every session by reading this file plus `docs/llm-context-protocol/protocol.md`.
2. Before taking a task, open the most recent log in `docs/llm-context-protocol/session-logs/` (`YYYY-MM-DD-sessionlog.md`) and be ready to restate the protocol + latest context to the user if asked.
3. Use `yarn` for ALL package management commands (install, build, dev, test, etc). NEVER use npm. Always use `yarn` unless the user explicitly instructs otherwise.
4. Keep every response aligned with the protocol's lifecycle rules, update `llm-memory.json` when anything changes, and add a new dated session log in `docs/llm-context-protocol/session-logs/` before you sign off.
5. Never credit yourself in commit messages. No "Generated with Claude Code", no "Co-Authored-By: Claude", no AI attribution of any kind.
