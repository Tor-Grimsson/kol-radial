Create a comprehensive session log following the llm-context-protocol format.

## Before Starting:
1. Read `LLM_RULES.md` to reinforce project rules
2. Remember: Never add AI attribution in commit messages (no "Generated with Claude Code", no "Co-Authored-By: Claude")

## Instructions:

Generate a detailed session log document that captures all work done in this session. The log should follow this structure:

### 1. Session Metadata
- Date and time
- Session duration (approximate)
- Main objectives/goals

### 2. Work Completed
List all tasks completed in chronological order:
- Feature implementations
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Configuration changes
- Any other modifications

### 3. Technical Details
For each major change:
- Files modified
- Key code changes with before/after examples
- Reasoning behind decisions
- Any challenges encountered and how they were solved

### 4. Issues & Solutions
Document any problems encountered:
- Error messages
- Debugging steps
- Final resolution

### 5. Testing & Verification
- Manual testing performed
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Any remaining issues or follow-ups needed

### 6. Next Steps
- Remaining tasks
- Future improvements
- Technical debt identified

## Output Format:
- Save the log to: `docs/llm-context-protocol/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-sessionlog.md`
- Use clear markdown formatting
- Include code snippets where relevant
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
